This stacked-together pile of food items brings our current total to 108 items for the food drive. What a great way to kick off the drive! We are currently ahead of the high school, but we need to keep up the momentum until Friday, March 10!

Incentives for the middle schoolers are as follows:- 400 items - extra 15 minutes at recess- 800 items - extra 30 minutes at recess- 1500 items - “mystery surprise!”
