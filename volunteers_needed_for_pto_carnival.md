Please join us for the Shepherd Elementary PTO carnival on Saturday, March 18th, 2017! Volunteers will be greatly appreciated. We need over 100 volunteers that will be split into two shifts. The first shift will be 11:30-1:30 pm and the second is from 1:15-3:15 pm. Volunteers will receive a voucher for a free lunch combo, a professional certificate, and will be entered into a drawing to receive a $25 Meijer gift card. Sign up waivers can be found in the high school office. Be sure to come and get a sign up sheet and turn it in by Friday, March 10th!
